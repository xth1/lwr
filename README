------------------
|  REQUIREMENTS  |
------------------

The program needs an installed c++ distribution. We advice the use of g++ 

We have tested the programs on linux (ubuntu), and mac OSX.

------------------
|  INSTALLATION  |
------------------

You should simply execute the following command inside the folder
lwr-pack.

$ make 

-----------
|  USAGE  |
-----------

lwr_test_metaheuristic permutation number_of_iteration inversion_limit frame_limit is_signed cost_function {-r=[[...]]}.

Parameters description:
 1. permutation: the input permutation.

 2. number_of_iteration: number of iterations that will
be performed by the Metaheuristic.

 3. inversion_limit: limit (upper bound) for the number of inversions
that will be selected at each iteration of the heuristic for building solutions.

 4. frame_limit: percentege (in the interval (0,100]) of frames that
will be selected at each iteration of the Metaheuristic.

 5. is_signed: 1 if the input permutation is signed, 0 otherwise.

 6. cost_function: 1 for linear function, 2 for quadratic function and 3 logaritmic function.

 7. -r=[[...]]: Optional parameter to give a seed solution as a input parameter
